Tracking time and position of an employee.

If you'd like to know more about it, I invite to you to watch the YouTube presentation:

Client is sending information about check-in/check-out time as well as its location to the server with sql database. 
Server can create new accounts for the employees with automatically generated PIN to the app, and show their monthly time statistics, as well as their 
check-in/check-out position on the visual map.

You can find the client side here: https://github.com/dlrzz/toggle-client
